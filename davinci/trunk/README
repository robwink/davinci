This is the README file for daVinci, a hyperspectral math engine,
developed for JPL under contract #959904.  You can always obtain the
latest version of daVinci from ftp://east.la.asu.edu/pub/software/davinci

Compiling
---------
DaVinci requries an ANSI C compiler.  A configuration script has been 
included to make compilation as straight forward as possible.  In
most instances you should be able to run configure, and then run make:

		% ./configure
        % make
        % make install


Documentation
-------------
    The documentation is in the docs directory.  You should find in there:

    In HTML format, viewable with any WWW browser (mosaic, netscape, etc)
        primer.html         - a basic tutorial
        intro.html          - an introductory page
        davinci.html        - a comprehensive reference manual

    The same files are also available in Postscript (*.ps) and ASCII (*.txt)
	
	The file functions.txt, is a complete listing of all the available
	functions, and describes each in detail.  This document will eventually
	get converted to HTML format.
