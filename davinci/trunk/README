This is the README file for daVinci, a hyperspectral math engine,
developed for JPL under contract #959904.  You can always obtain the
latest version of daVinci from ftp://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/pub/davinci/dv.tar.Z

Compiling
---------
DaVinci requires an ANSI C compiler, lex and yacc.  A configuration script
has been included that should work on most systems.  To configure daVinci,
just run the configure script from this directory.

        % ./configure

This will a Makefile, and a config.h header file, at which time, 
you should be able to just run:

        % make
        % make install

If for some reason your make is broken, you can probably compile most
everything manually with something similar to the following:

        % cc -D_NO_PROTO *.c -o davinci -lm

If you don't have an ANSI compiler, see about getting gcc, a free ANSI C
compiler available from prep.ai.mit.edu.


Documentation
-------------
    The documentation is in the docs directory.  You should find in there:

    In HTML format, viewable with any WWW browser (mosaic, netscape, etc)

        intro.html          - an introductory page
        primer.html         - a basic tutorial
        davinci.html        - a comprehensive reference manual

    The same files are also available in Postscript (*.ps) and ASCII (*.txt)
    
    The file functions.txt, is a complete listing of all the available
    functions, and describes each in detail.  This document will eventually
    get converted to HTML format.
